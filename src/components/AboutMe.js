        <div>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Sofía Cheung, born and raised in Panama and currently living in the Bay Area. I attended Holberton School of Software Engineering and specialized in Full-Stack Web Development. Having learned the basics of programming at school and then being able to build complex projects on my own, I can sincerely say that I like what I do. I can't wait to start my career as a Full Stack Software Engineer and be part of a community that values innovation, teamwork and learning. Besides coding, I’m a fan of watercolor art, playing the ukulele and video chatting with my family/friends in Panama.</p>
